In this project, we are given a data set, a rich source of information about individuals' preferences, lifestyle choices, and personal attributes. The primary objective is to conduct a series of tasks encompassing data loading, exploration, cleaning, and preparation, followed by the application of machine learning models for predictive analysis in three distinct areas: Zodiac sign prediction, body type prediction, and income prediction. Additionally, we will engage in a gender prediction task based on education level and income as the given features.
Due to the file size limitation of Git-Hub, I have attached the link to the data set to my google share drive here.
